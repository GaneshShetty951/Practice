# Twin Number
When the number is 64,253 is multiplied by 365 the product is 23,452,345. Notice that the first four digits are the same as the last four digits (2345 and 2345). Write a program that will find any and all integers that can be multiplied by 365 to produce an eight-digit product where the first four digits are the same as the last four digits.
···In the example above, no digits were repeated, but in your program, the product can have repetition. For example, 44,884,488. (Hint: Use mod)

# Power
 Given an integer n > 1 and an integer p > 1 you are to write a program that determines the positive nth root of p. In this problem, given such integers n and p, p will always be of the form k^n for an integer k ( this integer is what your program much find).
Example:
1.Input 2 2 (n=2, p=2).
··* output no such integer k.
2.Input 5 243 (n=5, p=243).
··* Output k=3.

# Number=sum of cubes of individual digits
Given a positive integer as input. If it has exactly three digits,then determine if the integer equals the sum of the cubes of its digits.
OUTPUT SHOULD LOOK LIKE:
1.The integer 153 is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits.
2.The integer 103 is not equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits.
3.The integer 56 does not have three digits.
