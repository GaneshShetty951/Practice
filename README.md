When the number is 64,253 is multiplied by 365 the product is 23,452,345. Notice that the first four digits are the same as the last four digits (2345 and 2345). Write a program that will find any and all integers that can be multiplied by 365 to produce an eight-digit product where the first four digits are the same as the last four digits.
In the example above, no digits were repeated, but in your program, the product can have repetition. For example, 44,884,488. (Hint: Use mod)
